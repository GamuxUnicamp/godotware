'Godotware' is the game created by Computer Science and Computer Engineer freshman of Unicamp (Universidade Estadual de Campinas) with the help of Gamux, the university game development student group. It's mainly a learning project, serving the purpose of teaching basic game devlopment skills while creating a complete game by using smaller projects that could be made on a short time constrain.

The project was created using Godot, an Open-Source (MIT) game engine; the project itself is also Open-Source, hopefully contributing to the FOSS games ecosystem.
