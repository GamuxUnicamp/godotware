<p>‘Godotware’ is the game created by Computer Science and Computer Engineer freshman of Unicamp (Universidade Estadual de Campinas) with the help of Gamux, the university game development student group. It’s mainly a learning project, serving the purpose of teaching basic game devlopment skills while creating a complete game by using smaller projects that could be made on a short time constrain.</p>

<p>The game is based on ‘WarioWare’-like games; a collection of 5-second microgames in sequence with just a few instructions on what to do. This design was helpful to teach basic Godot concepts and game-development mechanics, while contributing to a bigger project.</p>

<p>The project was created using Godot, an Open-Source (MIT) game engine; the project itself is also Open-Source, hopefully encouraging more projects for the FOSS games ecossystem.</p>
