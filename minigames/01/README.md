# Godotware - Minigame Boilerplate

## How to use it

 - Duplicate the folder */minigames/minigame_boilerplate* and change its name to a
 not repeated two character number. Be sure to maintain this new folder inside
 */minigames*.
 - Change the *XX-minigame_boilerplate.tscn* name. Be sure to use the same two digit
 number used in this folders name.
 - Change the *minigame_boilerplate.gd* name.
 - Inside Godot, open your newly named scene and make sure the main node is using
 the correct renamed gd script.
 - Now you're able to edit your new minigame's scene and script! ^^
